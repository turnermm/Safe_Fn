SafeFN_class.js
  All functions for coding and decoding safe filenames are incorporated into 
  the SafeFN class.  There are two accessor functions outside of the class:
                
	SafeFN_encode(filename)
            takes a utf8 filename and returns a safe filename

	SafeFN_decode(filename)
             takes a safe filename and returns a utf8 filename

    This class incorporates several functions from

safeFN.js
  This does the same job as the SafeFN class, but the functions are not enclosed in a class.  
  There are two functions for encoding and decoding safe filenames:

      	Safe_encode(filename)  
          creates a safe filename from a utf8 string (filename)
	Safe_decode(filename) {   
          decodes a 'safe' encoded file name and return a UTF8 string

        This script includes a completedset of the functions for encoding and decoding utf8 strings
